Disaster management (also called emergency management or disaster response) is a process of effectively preparing for and responding to disasters. It involves strategically organizing resources to lessen the harm that disasters cause. It also involves a systematic approach to managing the responsibilities of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
- **Mitigation**: This phase includes actions taken to prevent or reduce the cause, impact, and consequences of disasters. Example: adopting or amending building codes to optimize safety for all future building construction.
- **Preparedness**: This phase includes planning, training, and educational activities for events that cannot be mitigated. Example: developing disaster preparedness plans for what to do, where to go, or who to call for help in a disaster.
- **Response**: This phase occurs in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. During this phase, business and other operations do not function normally. Personal safety and wellbeing in an emergency and the duration of the response phase depend on the level of preparedness. Example: conducting search and rescue missions.
- **Recovery**: During this period, restoration efforts occur concurrently with regular operations and activities. The recovery period from a disaster can be prolonged. Example: preventing or reducing stress-related illnesses and excessive financial burdens.
