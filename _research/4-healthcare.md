Healthcare analytics is the process of analyzing current and historical industry data to predict trends, improve outreach, and even better manage the spread of diseases. Healthcare analytics focuses on the application of data science, business analytics, information technology, operations research, statistics, simulation, optimization, and mathematical modelling to decision-making and problem-solving in healthcare organizations within the private and public sectors.
- **Descriptive Analytics** answers the question of what happened by analyzing historical data and extracting hindsight about the past, without explaining why
- **Diagnostic Analytics** answers the question of why something happened by measuring historical data against other data (i.e., benchmarks) and extracting insight into the present
- **Predictive Analytics** answers the question of what will happen by using the findings of descriptive and diagnostic analytics and giving the foresight for the future
- **Prescriptive Analytics** answers the question of what to do by using the findings of descriptive and diagnostic analytics and giving the prescription for the future to eliminate a problem or take advantage of a promising trend
