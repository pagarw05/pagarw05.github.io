title: "Teaching Philosophy"

While teaching, I strongly rely on *student-centered* and *problem-based strategies*. 
- **Student Feedback**: I regularly encourage students in providing feedback so that I can leverage their expectations, needs, and interests in making necessary improvements and/or adjustments to the learning environment, course materials, and teaching style. 
- **Learn by Doing**: Instead of directly presenting raw technical concepts, I use real-world problems and examples to promote student learning of concepts and principles. 
- **Effective Communication**: I put in my best efforts to provide personalized attention using proper communication channels to help students overcome their struggles and master the course materials.  
- **Prompt Response**: I also respond to all emails from students promptly so that they can have their questions quickly answered and thus, have sufficient time to complete their tasks efficiently.
- **Grading and Feedback**: I prioritize grading and returning assignments promptly with detailed comments so that students have enough time to review their work in preparation for future assignments and exams. 

These efforts help students to feel more comfortable in initiating further contacts and generating a positive learning and feedback cycle.
